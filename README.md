# Personal Portfolio

**Milestone 1 project for Code institute Software Development Programme.** 

This website is a personal portfolio showcasing my personal information, work history, skills and projects to recruiters and potential employers. The website allows for impressed individuals and employers to make contact for job opportunities, freelance and project collaborations. 

 
## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features

#### Header
Navbar: Used bootstraps navbar for a responsive header. The header is transparent and fixed to the top of the page with my name as the nav logo.
For large screens navigation links are visible as:
*   About
*	Projects
*	Contact

There is also a resume button on the top right corner of the page that opens to a file in a new tab.
For medium and smaller screens, the navigation links and resume button are presented within a hamburger icon as.
*	About
*	Projects
*	Contact
*	Resume

#### Sections
Home: This section contains the main background image taking up full height and width of the page. A brief introduction is given as the header to the page and an inviting circular button at the bottom to take user to the next section. 

About: This section contains a personal introduction and icons/text to showcase skills. 

Projects: This section showcases five projects on large devices and four projects on devices smaller than large. On medium and smaller devices there is also a button directing to all the projects on a new tab.

Contact: This section contains a form to make contact for opportunities and includes required inputs:
*   Name
*   Email
*   Message

#### Footer
Footer: The footer contains nav links to social media pages and copyright information. There is also a vertical text in large devices when pressed goes back to home page and the text is changed to an icon for smaller devices.

### Features Left to Implement
-   The projects section will get much bigger with more projects to come. Thus, the structure will change. With more projects the column and row features could be removed and also add a ‘more’ button to larger screens.
-	Also, the header nav links can clash with backgrounds and a feature which changes the colour when scrolling could be implemented. 


## Technologies Used

-	HTML5: For the structure of the site.
-	CSS3: For styling of the site.
-	Bootsrap5: For fast development of the site and its responsiveness.
-	Fontawesome: For visual icons.
-	Github: For remote access of the project.
-	Gitpod: Development environment on the browser.
-	Git: For version-control.
-	Visual Studio Code: A development environment as an upgrade to gitpod.
-	Balsamiq: For designing wireframes.
-	Google fonts: Styling of the text.
-   Coolors: For selecting colour palette.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
